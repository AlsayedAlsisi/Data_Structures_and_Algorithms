* How to compile
Open terminal and type 
> make

* Design
The dynamic array solution is based on LinkedList data structure and dynamic memory allocation to make best use of memory.
Especial care was made to prevent against dynamic memory allocation problems and dangling pointers.

* Tests
All tests are implemented in Test component(test. and test.h) and can be run by calling test_run() API from main application(provided main.c).
